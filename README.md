# CITATIONS
This backend was based on a template developer by Northwestern Develop and Innovate for Social Change
(original repo: https://github.com/disc-template/backend)

This project uses [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) as the web application
framework.

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with
various plugins to handle code formatting.

We use [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as our database and authentication
provider.

For testing, we use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as our testing framework.

[Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) is used for automatic server restarts during
development.
